        <p>
          Love is a special bond that can help you sail through the most
          brutal storms of life. In you, my love, I have found a support
          that’s unwavering and unconditional. No matter where we stay, I always
          know you are the one I can always count on. So, a big thank you to you
          for being my partner and bestest friend for life!

          When the storm of the future comes to test our bond, the road seems
          Whether it’s through our morning walks (virtually or in person) or our
          endless video calls, you’ve filled my days with joy and love. Shimla
          holds such a special place in my heart—not just because it was a
          beautiful trip, but because I got to experience it with you.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each passing day reveals a new and better side of you. The more I know
          your beautiful soul, the more I fall for it. Its true, you mean everything for me,
          the one I will choose over everyone else. My dearest, purest, and
          rarest partner  I love you from the core of my heart. We met by
          chance, and now we are partners by choice,But, I surely do everything to upgrade this partnership. You are the best thing
          that ever happened to me. I am grateful to God a thousand times for
          bringing you into my life and making me complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          I got so attached to you because you never judged me even when you know I am a crook minded person. Thanks for believing in me. Thanks for nurturing
          this partnership with your precious time and efforts. You make me feel
          so secure and loved. I will make true all the promises I did. I love you so much.
        </p>
        <p>
          I feel so blessed to be a part of your life. Thank you for considering
          me your partner. I admire your personality so much; you’re the
          kindest and friendliest person I have ever met. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="page text-page" onclick="movePage(this, 5)">
        <p>You are humble,
            polite, helpful, and courageous. You inspire me to be a better person
            every day.
          I was never considered a good person by the world,I was dead,you saved me my saviour. You stayed with me and managed to stick around when others
          could have simply left. You made me what I am today. I can’t tell you
          how blessed I feel to be around you. Thank you for everything,my partner.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have taught me so much and always wished the best for me. You are
          one of the biggest reasons I could find my calling and follow my
          dreams. I must have done some good deeds in my previous life because,
          in this one, I have found a gem of a best friend,as partner.
          and, if you want I can say LOVER as well ❤️‍🩹 😉.
        </p>
        <p>
          A true partner is a treasure that is hard to find. But I so am glad I
          found you! I’m blessed to have you as my friend. Thank you for always
          being there when nobody else was. I love you so much that words can
          never express the actual depth of my feelings. You are a herald of
          good fortune for me. Since we met, my life has changed for the better.
          You are my best friend, and no matter what, I will never let you go.
        </p>
        <p>
            Those memories of us together, laughing, exploring, and just being in
            each other’s presence, will always remind me how lucky I am to have
            you. You’ve been my safe space, Bear. Your patience, your
            understanding, and the way you’ve gently loved me have made me a
            better person.

          Frankly, I can keep talking about you all day and night, and still be
          left with a million more things to say. You are the most amazing
          individual I have ever met. And I cannot envision my life without you
          in it. You are one of the greatest treasures of my life. I hope we
          continue being best friends till the last breaths of our lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want you to know that having a fantastic partner like you is a
          blessing. Your love and friendship is more valuable than all the treasures in
          the universe. I could never have imagined how you could have touched
          my heart in so many different ways, and I will always cherish our
          friendship with everything I have in me. I adore you, my lovely
          friend.
        </p>
        <p>
            You’re my biggest supporter, my cheerleader, and my reason to smile. I
            don’t know what I did to deserve someone as amazing as you, but I’ll
            spend every day making sure you feel just as loved and cherished as
            you make me feel.
